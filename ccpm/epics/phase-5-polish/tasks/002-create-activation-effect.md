# Create activation effect

## Description
Design and implement the visual effect when Konami Code is activated.

## Options (choose one)
1. **Dark Wikipedia** - Toggle dark theme with special styling
2. **Matrix Theme** - Green text on black with falling code
3. **Retro Gaming** - 8-bit transformation with pixel effects
4. **Hidden Content** - Reveal secret projects section

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Effect is visually impressive
- [ ] Effect can be toggled off
- [ ] "Achievement Unlocked" message displayed
- [ ] Optional: sound effect

## Recommendation
Dark Wikipedia theme is easiest since dark mode already exists. Could enhance with:
- Special "Achievement Unlocked" toast
- Subtle animation on activation
- Console message: "Achievement Unlocked: Master Gamer"
